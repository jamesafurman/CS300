What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

  Allowing professors at ABC University to load a list of courses into a searchable data structure (including those coursesâ€™ names, IDs, and prerequisites) and print all courses in order or search for a course by its ID. 


How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

  I had two considerations in my approach to the problem: first, the efficiency of the program, and second, forward-compatibility with functionality that is likely to be required of such a program in the future. Given these, there was no difference in worst-case efficiency among the various data structures we considered for the project, but a search tree stood to be most forward-compatible and more runtime-efficient in the functionality likely to be added.


How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

  I encountered few roadblocks in these projects and dealt with them by reading error messages and reviewing instructional material relevant to whatever was giving me trouble (mainly raw pointer implementation). Once or twice, those venues of recourse failed and I resorted to inserting cout statements near the problem and moving them around to figure out exactly where the bug was, and then carefully rereading the buggy code. 


How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

  I believe my coding fundamentals are solid and my main task going forward is to increase my base of knowledge for implementing common designs. This project, and more generally this class, have contributed to that by providing practicable knowledge of data structures and algorithm analysis that allow me to design and develop software with greater refinement. 


How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  This project let me continue writing readable and maintainable code; it did not entail any extremely complex design, so achieving maintainability was not challenging. It also provided me an opportunity to consider the adaptability/extensibility of the program according to its use purpose, and I factored that consideration into my design.
